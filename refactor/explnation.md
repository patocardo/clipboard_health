# Explanation for the refactored code

In the refactored code, I removed unnecessary nested if statements and added an early exit to avoid excessive branching. I also simplified the variable declaration and initialization by setting candidate to the trivial partition key value upfront.

Furthermore, I used the else if statement to avoid unnecessary hashing when event.partitionKey is present. Additionally, I removed the redundant check for candidate being a string and converted it to a string using JSON.stringify only if it's not a string.

Lastly, I reordered the code to follow a natural flow, with variable declarations at the top, followed by the main logic and finally the return statement. This makes it easier to read and understand the code.

The refactored code is more readable because it's concise, follows a natural flow, and avoids unnecessary branching and steps. It's also easier to understand the main logic since it's separated into distinct blocks. Lastly, I used modern JS syntax like let and const for variable declarations and else if statements for better readability.
